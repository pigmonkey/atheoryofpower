# Preface

I began writing this book while puzzling about the nature of power. I was debating the cause of the state of the world: is our present situation the result of some mysterious conspiracy, or is it the logical result of natural processes of power? As I looked into the nature of power, it became increasingly clear that the prominent actors and forces in the world today are emergent phenomena, resulting from a dominant, hierarchal pattern of power. The structure of power, it seems, is the root cause of the problems humanity struggles to solve. The result of my inquiry -- this Theory of Power -- is my attempt to understand root causes and to present a toolkit addressing the daunting problems facing our civilization.

The first eight chapters outline my theory as it parallels the development of civilization and humanity. The ninth chapter provides my suggested tools to solve the problems presented. The goal of this book is to both present the world in a new and revealing way, and to provide suggestions that inspire the reader with implementable solutions.

I would also like to take this opportunity to grant blanket permission to reproduce and use any portion of this text for any non-commercial purpose. I hope that the message of this book reaches as large an audience as possible -- and for that, I request your support.
