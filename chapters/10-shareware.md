Well, that's all of "A Theory of Power". I think that it's important to offer this book as open source. If you've read this far, then I hope that means that you found it valuable. If you did, then please help support the further development of these concepts by [purchasing a hardcopy of this book](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0595330304/). It's only $10, and if you like, you can help spread these ideas by purchasing "A Theory of Power" as a gift.

Thanks.
