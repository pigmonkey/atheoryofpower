# A Theory of Power

[Jeff Vail][1] published A Theory of Power in 2004. It is [freely available on
his blog][2], as well as for [purchase on Amazon][3]. In the preface of the
hard-copy the author grants "blanket permission to reproduce and use any
portion of this text for any non-commercial purpose."

Wanting to replace my old hard-copy with a e-reader friendly digital version, I
have formatted the text as Markdown, suitable for processing via [Pandoc][4].
